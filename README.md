# Partial-Clinic-Management-System
A GUI based application implementing Object-Oriented concepts using Java Swing. It was completed as a project for Object-Oriented Programming-1 (Java) course during Fall-19.

# Features

**Admin**
-	An Admin can view all other users (i.e: Receiptionist, Doctor) and search them by  their name and type
-	Can “add” a new employee (a “Doctor” or a “Receiptionist”)  
-	Can edit details of any employee
-	Can delete an employee
-	Hence, an Admin can do all the “CRUD” operations

**Receiptionist**
-	Search a “Doctor” by their name or by specialty
-	Register a patient and insert that into a particular “Doctor’s” personal database

**Doctor**
-	Can view his registered patient’s list

# OOP and Java Concepts Used
- **Four pillars of Object Oriented Programming:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism
-	**Association:** Creating another class’s object in current class.
-	**Swing Components:** Used many JComponents such as: JTextField, JButton, JTable etc.
-	**Swing Containers:** Used JContainers such as JFrame, JPanel etc.

# Tools Used
-	IntelliJ IDEA - as development environment
-	Xampp - as web server (for using MySQL database management)
